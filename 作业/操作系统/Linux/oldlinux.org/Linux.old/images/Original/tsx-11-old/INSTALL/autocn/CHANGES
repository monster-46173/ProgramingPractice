     I don't know if you read the changes file in the previous version,
     so I will summarize it.  I sold my home in Santa Barbara, and moved
     to a small town in Northern California to concentrate on writing
     shareware full time.  Well (you may ask), how's it going.

     Since my program was reviewed on page 50 in the Nov. 13, 1990 issue
     of PC Magazine, registrations have increased significantly.
     Appearantly a lot of people read (and pay attention to) PC
     Magazine.  Site registrations have really increased, and I now have
     some Fortune 50 customers.  Banks, however, make up the bulk of
     the Site Licensees.

     I ran into a few tax problems (it was either pay Uncle a lot of
     money, or put a lot of money into my house), so I've been
     consulting pretty heavily the last year and doing major
     reconstruction to my house.  I think I am finally through with any
     big consulting jobs (and with rebuilding my house), so now AutoCon
     will be getting a lot more attention.

     This is still not the release I had planned (it will probably show
     up some time around July), but one of my competitors was on
     Compuserve saying how much better he was than I because his program
     could handle DOS 5.0's HIGH and UMB flags.  I decided I needed to
     add this capability to AutoCon and get out a new release before he
     could cause any more problems.  So with this release, AutoCon will
     handle both MSDOS 5.0's HIGH and UMB flags, and it is compatible
     with DRDOS which is one up on my competitor.

     The 2.1 release of AutoCon will have a lot more editor
     enhancements.  I'm planning pull down menus (similar to the front
     screen), and a split screen capability.  I also intend to allow
     Search/Replace operations to go automatically through all
     configurations.  I will also be able to use the screen size in
     effect when AutoCon is started, instead of switching everything to
     the 80X25 mode.

     I have a support BBS online and functional.  The number is (916)
     623 4455, and it is in operation 24 hours a day.  It has a 9600+
     BAUD modem that is CompuCom CSP, V32, and V42 compatible (of course
     it connects just fine at 2400 <or less> BAUD).  The main function
     of the BBS is (of course ) AutoCon support.  If it gets busy
     enough, it will grow into a full multi-line BBS.  As a consequence
     there are several megabytes of downloadable files on it, always
     including the latest shareware release of AutoCon. I will also set
     up a section for a group of Beta testers, so let me know if you are
     interested in becomming one.  I see several enhancements in
     AutoCons future, as well as a few other programs that I have in
     mind.

     This is my first BBS and I'm sure there will be will be some
     growing pains, so please bear with me.

     I love the place I've moved to and I thank you very much for the
     support you have given to AUTOCON, and for giving me the incentive
     to change careers.
