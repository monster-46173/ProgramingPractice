If you are running a Cache program, and do not have it set to write
through, then (if you have Autocon set for a Warm or Cold boot -- and
probably External) you must configure Autocon to "Flush" your cache.
Hit the <F4> key, and put in the command string that causes your cache
to flush.  The command should be listed in the documentation for your
Cache program.  Autocon will then save the information, and perform a
"Flush" before each reboot.

If you are not sure if your Cache is set to "write through", please
configure Autocon to do the "Flush", just to be on the safe side.

The symptoms of a cache problem is that the Autoexec and Config files do
not get updated, and/or any edited Autocon configurations do not get
saved.  In the worst case, the Autocon.Dat file will get corrupted, and
your screen colors will disappear (screen will be blank when you start
AutoCon).

Setting Autocon up to do the "Flush" will remove the problems.

Some Flush commands that I know are:

       PC-KWIK -    SUPERPCK /F
       PC-CACHE -   PC-CACHE /FLUSH
       FLASH -      FLASH /F?
       HYPERDISK -  HYPERDK W
       SMARTDRV -   SMARTDRV /C  (new ver with WINDOWS 3.1)



Sorry for any inconvenience,
