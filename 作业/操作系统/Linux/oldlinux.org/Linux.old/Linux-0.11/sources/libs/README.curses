curses.tar.Z contains the curses library from bsd-net-2, with
pre-installed diffs & RCS files for linux changes.
You'll need to use 'pmake' to build it, or reconstruct the Makefile.

I'm not completely certain that I got all of the raw(), crmode() etc
stuff right.  If you have applications that use curses, try them out and
send back patches if you find bugs.
