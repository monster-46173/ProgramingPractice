The bochs image files collected in this directory are built several years ago.
They can be ran normally under Buchs 2.2.X version. But when you use these image
files under one of the recent high Bochs verions, you may encounter some incompatible
problems when using those old  *.bxrc with them. 

The fix method is easy. Just modify the *.bxrc file as following: 

1. Modify the "romimage" line to the exact like this:
	romimage: file=$BXSHARE/BIOS-bochs-latest

2. Modify the "vgaromimage" line like this: 
	vgaromimage: file = $BXSHARE/VGABIOS-lgpl-latest

3. Comment out or delete the following lines:
	#parport1: enable=0
  	#floppy_command_delay: 50000
  	#ips: 4000000
  
That's all!
